# Roadmap

## Must-haves
- [ ] Auto martyria calc must handle chroa scales
- [ ] Mode Key selector with default mode keys
- [X] Bottom fthoras
- [ ] Right-align option for martyria
- [ ] Tempo markings
- [ ] Measure neumes
- [ ] Arga neumes
- [ ] More adjustments and replacements
- [X] Empty drop caps should be deleted
- [ ] Move to Electron

## Nice-to-haves
- [X] Delete button in toolbar
- [ ] Document Settings Dialog
- [ ] Microtonal Sharps and Flats
- [ ] Custom Martyrias
- [ ] Note Indicators
- [ ] Ison Neumes
- [ ] Header Images
- [ ] Headers/Footers/Page Numbers
- [ ] Add empty neume box at end of score if missing (e.g. due to corrupted save file)
- [ ] Copy/Cut/Paste elements
- [ ] Undo / redo
- [ ] Configurable Neume Keyboard
- [ ] Icons (e.g. for page break and line break)

## Tech Debt
- [ ] Need to explicitly map between save file neumes and view model neumes. This will prevent errors due to mismatched or missing neumes in the save model.
